## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I'm really bad at naming things and I think people would be confused to understand my code, but I'll improve it and I'll use BEM naming rules on the next challenge.

Also, I need to use comments/remarks more often to make it easier for people to understand my code.
